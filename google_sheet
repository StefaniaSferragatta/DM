(1) the SQL code you have used to create the schema of your database (only create table and alter table statements (if any), not statements for inserting values)
(2) the SQL code of the queries (possibly with an explanation)
(3) the SQL code used for query optimization for HW2. For each query, indicate the un-optimized version and the optimized one. In case the optimization has been realized through indexes, insert the SQL code for the index creation; in case you have modified the schema (e.g. changed the domain of a field, or constructed a new materialized table, etc.), insert the code you have used for this modification.
